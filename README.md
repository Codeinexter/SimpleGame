## üéÆ Game Overview
SimpleGame is inspired by the classic Simon game. Players must observe a sequence of colored buttons that light up and then replicate the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons in the same order. With each correct repetition, the sequence grows longer, testing the player's memory and attention. The game ends when a mistake is made in the sequence.
