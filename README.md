# SimpleGame
This project is accomplished as part of GDGC Task.
# Instructions:
Round 1: Watch the coloured buttons light up. Repeat the sequence by pressing the same buttons in the same order.

Round 2 and beyond: After you correctly repeat the sequence, Computer will add one more color to the sequence. You must then repeat this new, longer sequence. Continue repeating the sequences as they get longer and more complex.

Mistakes: If you press a button out of order, the game will signal a mistake, and the game will end.
